# LTLMoP GR(1) Specifications

This directory contains example GR(1) specifications pulled from LTLMoP (https://ltlmop.github.io).
Since there is cross-pollination between LTLMoP and Slugs (https://github.com/VerifiableRobotics/slugs), 
variants several of these examples can also be found on the Slugs repository.

Ideally, each specification in this directory should contain a comment that briefly describes the purpose of 
the specification.
